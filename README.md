# PassProtect
This is a daemon based application that monitors the launch of other applications. It allows you to choose one application and use a password to prevent it from launching.

It includes a preference window where you can choose the password and the application to protect. It also allows you to choose to start it at login.


## Versions
This project includes three versions of essentially the same thing.

- PassProtect script: This is the original basic AppleScript
- PassProtect Xcode AppleScript: This was the next iteration of the program. It was still based on AppleScript, but it was bundled as an application with Xcode.
- PassProtect Xcode Obj-C: The final iteration. This version is written in native Obj-C and has the most features. It is not completed as of yet.

The current working version if the Xcode AppleScript version. It is the most robust, although not as fully featured as the Obj-C version.
